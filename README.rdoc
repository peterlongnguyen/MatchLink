This project was intended to allow you to search through your events from Meetup and EventBrite for people with specific 
skillsets (e.g. programming, sales, design) by pattern matching through LinkedIn's API.  I realized after that this amounted to
incredibly difficult machine learning, so this project is abandoned.
